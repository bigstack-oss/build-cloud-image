# The vault.ist system uses the connecting IP address of the client and the
# update status of each vault.to pick current vault. that are geographically
# close to the client.  You should use this for CentOS updates unless you are
# manually picking other vault..
#
# If the vault.ist does not work for you, you can try the commented out
# baseurl line instead.
